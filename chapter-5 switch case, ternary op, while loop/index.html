        // what is switch case ?
        // it is a conditional statement that allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
        // each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.
        // syentax:
        /*
        switch(expression) {
            case value1:
                // code to be executed if expression === value1

                // code to be executed if expression === value2

        // what is ternary operator?
        // it is a conditional operator that takes three operands.
        //can you translate in hindi?
        // It is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. 
        // which three operands are:
        // 1. a condition to be evaluated   
        // 2. a value to be returned if the condition is true
        // 3. a value to be returned if the condition is false
        // syntax:
        // condition ? value if true : value if false

        // what is loop?
        // it is a programming construct that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times.
        // loops types ?
        // entry controlled loop and exit controlled loop
        // entry controlled loop types?
        // for loop and while loop  
        // exit controlled loop types?
